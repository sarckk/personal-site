As a community, programmers have often expressed disdain for marketing executives. Perhaps this is because much of marketing, which involves going against logic, runs antithetical to the reverence for logic and numbers which characterises by the rational mind of the programmer. Ultimately, however, even programming exists to serve a human need — usually in the form of products like Google or Twitter — and is therefore complemented by, and depends on marketing, the failure of which can turn even the most brilliant engineering moot. As engineers, there are a lot to learn from this book.

Through convincing examples and well-crafted arguments, *Alchemy* refutes against the binary view that the opposite of logical is wrong, and urges readers to consider a broader set of solutions to problems instead of blindly applying data-driven, rational solutions. While theory has its uses, Sutherland argues, applying a purely rational analysis to the human mind and desires (which are heavily context-dependent and often irrational) often is not only limiting but also misguiding, preventing us from discovering effective solutions at fractions of the cost. 

A veteran of the advertising industry himself, Sutherland offers valuable insights into the human mind. He points out that the problem with the rational approach to marketing (such as market research) is that customers often don't know why they want what they want. 

>People don’t think what they feel, they don’t say what they think, and they don’t do what they say. — Ogilvy

In addition, there's a lot of complex factors at play when one decides what to buy, for example. While one would assume that customers would necessarily want the *best* product on the market, Sutherland argues that the average customer is more likely to "satisfice": that is, settle for a brand which may not be the best, but which offers the least bad outcome should something go wrong. In a similar vein, the existence of [Veblen goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp) underscores the complexity of the human decision-making algorithm, and refutes the claim that all human behaviours can be meaningfully captured using standard economic analysis.

Another interesting point which I came across in the book was that of ***costly signalling***. This can be seen in nature in say, the flamboyance of the peacock's feathers. While this extravagance makes the peacock highly visible in the wild, the resultant decreases in the chances of survival is counterbalanced by the increase in reproductive fitness. The idea is that we derive meaning **in proportion to how extraordinary or unusual the circumstance is**. This is why, for example, a hand-written letter of invitation is likely to receive more response than a cheap printed one. The book even mentions Mark Changizi's idea that water tastes bland so as to calibrate the human taste buds to elements which have a smell/flavor/taste which deviate from the ordinary (for evolutionary reasons). Applied to marketing, one can now begin to understand why companies spend millions to buy airtime for a Superbowl commercial. 

As a programmer, an example particularly relevant to me was that of the so-called [$300M button](https://www.fastcompany.com/90183823/the-300-million-continue-button), a title given to the "Continue" button which allowed the customers of an ecommerce site to check out as a guest and choose to sign up later. This simple UI change resulted in a $300 million increase in revenue in the first year. To add to the puzzlement to those who saw it happen, around 90% of users ended up registering as users following the purchase. This example should be particularly relevant to designers and engineers alike, most of whom, like me, often forget the disproportionate impact that good design can bring about. In all, *Alchemy* reminds us that sometimes the best approach to solving a problem is changing our perspectives, and sometimes that means breaking out of the conventional and verging on alchemy.
