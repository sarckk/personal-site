As a community, programmers have often expressed disdain for marketing executives. Perhaps this is because much of marketing, which involves going against logic, runs antithetical to the reverence for logic and numbers which characterises by the rational mind of the programmer. Ultimately, however, even programming exists to serve a human need — usually in the form of products like Google or Twitter — and is therefore complemented by, and even depends on marketing, the failure of which can turn even the most brilliant engineering to moot. As engineers, there are a lot to learn from this book.

Through convincing examples, *Alchemy* argues against the binary view that the opposite of logical is wrong, and urges readers to consider a broader set of solutions (which border on the illogical) to problems instead of blindly applying data-driven, rational solutions. While theory has its uses, Sutherland argues, applying a purely rational analysis to the human mind and desires (which are heavily context-dependent and often irrational) often is not only limiting but also misguiding, preventing us from discovering effective solutions at fractions of the cost. 

A veteran of the advertising industry himself, Sutherland offers valuable insights into the human mind. He points out that the problem with the rational approach to marketing (such as market research surveys) is that customers often don't know why they want what they want, which could possibly be explained in terms of the evolutionary advantages offered by not being consciously aware of one's motivations. 

>People don’t think what they feel, they don’t say what they think, and they don’t do what they say. — Ogilvy

In addition, there's a lot of complex factors at play when deciding on which product to buy, for example. While one would surmise that customers would necessarily want to purchase the *best* product on the market, Sutherland argues that your average customer is more likely to "satisfice": that is, settle for a brand/make which may not be the best, but which offers the least bad outcome should something go wrong. In a similar vein, the existence of [Veblen goods](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp) underscores the complexity of the human decision-making algorithm, and refutes the claim that all human behaviours can be meaningfully captured using standard economic analysis.

Another interesting point which I came across in the book was that of costly signalling. This can be seen in nature in say, the flamboyance of the peacock's feathers. While this extravagance makes the peacock highly visible in the wild, the resultant decreases in the chances of survival is counterbalanced by the increase in reproductive fitness.
