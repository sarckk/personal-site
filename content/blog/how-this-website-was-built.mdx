In 2020, any reasonably motivated individual with a sense of agency could set themselves up a nice looking, performant website over the weekend, thanks to the [rise of the no-code movement](https://medium.com/@rrhoover/the-rise-of-no-code-e733d7c0944d) and with it, the proliferation of tools which allows people to make websites with virtually no code involved. Indeed, solutions like **Wix** and **Squarespace** abstracts away all the laborious HTML/CSS/JS work which power every website under the hood, and promises a hassle-free web development experience, allowing users to set up modern-looking websites in minutes. 

## A give and take
As wonderful as these tools are, they have a catch: by design, they offer limited ability for customization. Although some of the tools allow users to extend the basic templates they offer by manually entering CSS and JS snippets, they don't come close to the flexibility offered by custom-made solutions. This makes perfect sense, because the target customers for these tools are layment looking to quickly boostrap a personal site/blog, not programmers. There's a reason why web development is still in demand (and rapidly evolving still!) in 2020.

### The challenge
Being a computer science major, I couldn't possibly stoop to the lows of using **Wix**. Besides, I was fairly comfortable with the technical aspects of web development (having worked on making a website for a certain non-profit in Singapore back in 2016) and wanted to explore how this space had evolved since then. After some research, I learnt that static websites — serving static HTML files for faster loading speeds — were back in vogue, quite possibly underscoring the increased importance of delivering reliable, speedy experiences especially for critical web services, with corresponding significance placed on performance metrics such as [FMP (First meaningful paint)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/first-meaningful-paint) and [TTI (Time to Interactive)](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive).
